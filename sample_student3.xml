      <description>Course Rationale:
How do men and women survive—not just physically, but intellectually, creatively, spiritually—in the world? Our course examines texts that imaginatively model strategies to overcome physical deprivation (everything from enslavement to prison camp confinement to sexual violence) and social oppression (from religious persecution to gender discrimination). How does a legacy of psychic and social trauma manifest itself in the contemporary moment? How does the past impact not only the present but subsequent generations, as in the children of survivors? How do the historical specificities into which we are born impact what constitutes survival in the first place—just what is to be endured, resisted, reconsidered, embraced at any given time? How do social differences, often specific to time and place, inform not only survival but the post-survival period? How are often transnational considerations of race, ethnicity and gender, in particular, made and unmade within these texts—and further, what are the narrative as well as political means and ends of race, ethnicity, gender, and religion in these works? We will examine these questions through works that range from the seventeenth century to the present. Significantly, all the contemporary texts look back to critical moments in the past.</description>
